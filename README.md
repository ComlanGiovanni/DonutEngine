# DonutEngine

This is not an Engine like Unreal Engine, the name was picked because "Donut" alone was too bland.
This is just ASCII art animation inspired by Andy Sloane, check out his blog: https://www.a1k0n.net/

## Structure

- **ft_donut** - Version C du donut tournant en ASCII
- **CXX_Donut** - Version C++ du même algorithme
- **other/fire** - Différentes versions du feu ASCII (de complexe à simple)

## why?

Because i was bored..........zzZZZ

## Utilisation

```bash
# Version C du donut
cd ft_donut
make
./ft_donut

# Version C++ du donut
cd CXX_Donut
make
./ft_donut_cxx

# Animations de feu ASCII
cd other/fire
gcc compact_fire.c -o fire
./fire
```
